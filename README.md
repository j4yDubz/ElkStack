ELK: What? Where? Why?

     In my journey through setting up and configuring an ELK stack I’ve learned that I hate Azure and the Cloud. Joking aside, ELK is an acronym for the combined processes it uses. Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. This combination gives you the ability to aggregate logs from all of your systems and applications, analyze these logs, and create visualizations for monitoring. Additionally it can help faster troubleshooting, security analytics and more. In my environment, I deployed an ELK stack to gather logs from my virtual machine network that I have created through Microsoft’s Azure cloud service;  the mapping of the network and the process of the stack is visualized in two diagrams I have uploaded to my GitHub. Creating this stack will provide a simple, yet robust solution for log management and an analytic solution to monitor the infrastructure of my virtual network.
